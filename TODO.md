| Custom Aerodynamic Surfaces               | Create a new method in the Rocket Class that allows for custom aerodynamic coefficients such as Drag, Lift and Moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Easy                  | Basic Dynamics and Aerodynamics  |
| Multibody Dynamics Parachute Flight Phase | Currently, descent under parachute is simulated as a 3 degree of freedom (DOF) system. However, parachutes can and should be modeled separately from the rocket, creating a 6  (DOF) system, 2 for the parachute (spherical constrain) and 3 for the rocket. This can greatly enhance the prediction of the landing point. | Hard                  | Dynamics                         |

| Rocket Add Continuous Controller Method   | Add a method to the Rocket Class that allows the user to set a time-continuous, closed-loop, control function to be simulated during the flight.                                                                                                                                                                           | Easy                  | Basic Dynamics and Basic Control |
| Geodetic models                           | Make RocketPy capable of converting impact coordinates to useful lat / lon coordinates, based on different models of cartographic representation, such as WGS84 or NAD83 data.                                                                                                                                             | Easy - Medium         | None                             |
| Elevation profile data                    | Since the Earth is not flat, we can implement some functions that allow us to more accurately determine the impact coordinates by researching the point at which the rocket crosses the Earth's relief. Good candidates for this job are SRTM data.                                                                        | Medium                | None                             |
| Airfoil profiles                          | Currently, the Rocket class supports only flat fins, although the fins in real life can have more sophisticated aerodynamic profiles. To start solving this problem, we could allow the user to change the CLalpha of the fins before simulating.                                                                          | Easy                  | None                             |
| Integration with Fusion360 (or similar)   | Make RocketPy able to read a 3D geometry file that contains the entire Rocket description. This could save us a few minutes, as we would no longer need to measure multiple distances in our CAD software.                                                                                                                 | Medium-Hard           | Autodesk Fusion 360 API          |
